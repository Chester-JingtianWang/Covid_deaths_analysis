Since the virus first emerged in early 2020, it has spread rapidly and claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in the United States alone, with the number of deaths continuing to rise. In this project, we will delve deeper into the data on COVID-19 deaths in the United States to understand the patterns and trends in the spread of the virus and its impact on different age groups, states, and medical conditions. To do this, we will use a combination of exploratory data analysis and data visualization techniques. We will classify death cases by people’s ages, states, condition groups, and conditions, and use bar charts, line graphs, and other visualizations to uncover insights and highlight the most important findings. By understanding the factors that influence the spread of the COVID-19 virus and the severity of its impact, we can better inform public health policy and help protect the lives of those most at risk. Through this project, we aim to provide a comprehensive and thorough analysis of the data on COVID-19 deaths in the United States. By examining the data from multiple angles and using a range of data visualization techniques, we hope to shed light on the complex and evolving situation surrounding the pandemic, and to provide valuable insights for policymakers and public health officials. In studying, we mainly focus on the following specific questions: 1) The death distribution in the US by states; 2) The death distribution of people with different condition groups in each state; 3) The impact of each condition group on people with different ages; 4) The distribution of specific conditions under two condition groups, respiratory diseases and circulatory diseases; 5) The death distribution in each state by age groups; 6) What is the trend of death vs date in the US; 7) What is the trend of death vs date in each state "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic So far, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), the Covid-19 pandemic has already caused a total death of 1066351 in the United States. As its virus strains mutate, various types of Covid-19 such as Alpha, Beta and Delta keep emerging, causing different damage to patients with various health conditions, in each age group, in each area and in each time period. Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Therefore, to figure out the damage pattern of this virus among the public, it is necessary for us to show health conditions and contributing causes mentioned in conjunction with death involving COVID-19 by age group and jurisdiction of occurrence. Specifically, we plan to arrange COVID-19 death cases in groups according to people’s condition groups (respiratory disease, etc), detailed conditions (chronic lower respiratory diseases, adult respiratory distress syndrome, etc) and ages, and visualize their trends in the past 3 years in 50 states and the United States as a whole. 2.2 Data availability · What data sources did you consider? How did you decide which one(s) to analyze? Since our research orientation is Covid-19 health related analysis in the United States, the first data source we consider is the dataset from the CDC. We decided to use the Conditions Contributing to COVID-19 Deaths, by State and Age, Provisional 2020-2022 dataset from CDC because the dataset contains interesting information to analyze, such as date, age group, condition and death which could potentially answer the questions we come up with about our research topic. Moreover, the information of the dataset is fresh and up to date, last updated on 10/26/2022 and updates weekly. · Which institutions or individuals maintain the data source(s)? CDC, a reliable U.S. government institution maintains the data source, which makes the data trustworthy to use for our project. · How was the data collected? The provisional counts for COVID-19 deaths come from the information documented in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). The reported mortality information from death certificates was first submitted to the National Center for Health Statistics(NCHS) and then it was processed, coded, and stored in the NVSS. This process takes up to several weeks, so the dataset that we use has an information lag of about 1-2 weeks. Moreover, the data records for previous dates are also continuously updated depending on the new death certificate data received by NCHS for accuracy. However, we hold the opinion that there could be some deaths that are not recorded and reported by U.S. citizens. · In what format is the data available? The data is available in CSV format. · What steps do you need to take to import the data? The dataset can be downloaded directly from the CDC website in CSV format. The data will first be imported to Python for pre-processing, and we plan to import the CSV file as a pandas data frame through the pandas package in Python. After pre-processing in Python, the data will be exported to CSV file and imported to R by standard read_csv command. · If you have questions about the data, whom can you contact? We can reach out to the data center of CDC by email. cdcinfo@cdc.gov · Are there any known issues relating to data quality? After initial inspection we’ve noticed some columns with missing values. Since the dataset has over 470,000 rows, we will consider dropping the columns with missing values and that won’t affect overall data quality. · Citation National Center for Health Statistics.

We decided to use the Conditions Contributing to COVID-19 Deaths, by State and Age, Provisional 2020-2022 data set from CDC because the data set contains interesting information to analyze, such as date, age group, condition and death which could potentially answer the questions we come up with about our research topic. Moreover, the information of the data set is fresh and up to date, last updated on 10/26/2022 and updates weekly. The data set was collected based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. This data include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia which have been received and coded as of the date specified. Since it takes several weeks for death records to be submitted to National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), processed, coded, and tabulated, we should notice that the data may be incomplete, especially for the more recent time periods. Except from this data set, there are other similar COVID-19 death data from some local and state health departments. The reason why we choose this one is its comprehensiveness. Compared with other data sets, not only does this one include laboratory confirmed COVID-19 deaths, it also includes clinically confirmed COVID-19 deaths. 3.1.2 Basic information about the data Number of records: 471961 rows, 14 columns Type of variables: 1) “Date As Of”: date. This is the date of analysis. 2) “Start Date”: date. This is the first week-ending date of data period. 3) “End Date”: date. This is the last week-ending date of data period. 4) “Group”: chr. This is time-period indicator for record: by Month, by Year, Total. 5) “Year”: num. This is the year in which death occurred. 6) “Month”: num. This is the month in which death occurred. 7) “State”: chr. This is the jurisdiction of occurrence. 8) “Condition Group”: chr. This is the medical condition group. 9) “Condition”: chr. This is condition contributing to deaths involving COVID-19. 10) “ICD10_codes”: chr. This is the ICD-10 code for condition. 11) “Age Group”: chr. 12) “COVID-19 Deaths”: num. 13) “Number of Mentions”: num. 14) “Flag”: chr. Counts less than 10 suppressed. 3.1.3 Issues/problems with the data For “COVID-19 Deaths” and “Number of Mentions” columns, their accurate vales will not be revealed when they are between 1-9 since they are suppressed in accordance with NCHS confidentiality standards. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation Our data does not require any cleaning since it is already in a tidy form. It needs transformations for each of the graph made and the data frames for each graph are shown below. 3.2.1 Graph 1 3.2.1.1 2020-2022 ## region long lat group order subregion COVID.19.Deaths ## 1 alabama -87.46201 30.38968 1 1 &lt;NA&gt;

By adding up the number of missing values in the data frame,we can see that there are 667,064 missing values. Based on the “Total Missing Values” chart, it is not a large proportion of the total data points. “FALSE” on the x-axis of the chart represents cells in the data frame that have no missing values. “TURE” represents cells with missing values. However, based on the top chart in the first plot, for the columns, the Flag column has about 70% of values missing, COVID-19 Deaths and number of mentions columns have about 25% of values missing, and months and years have about less than 10% of values missing. For the Flag column, its appearance only means that the values of COVID-19 deaths and number of mentions are between 1-9. Therefore, the missing value in the Flag column does not matter at all. For the ‘COVID-19 Deaths’ and ‘Number of Mentions’ columns, we think it is not a big deal because those missing values indicate that some of the values with small counts between 1-9 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS confidentiality standards, so it is rational. What’s more, since these missing values are just between 1-9, they will not have a great influence on the final analysis. For the Month column and the Year column, the reason they have missing values is some of the rows represent the COVID data in 2020-2022 (which leads to value missing in Year and Month) or in the whole year (which leads to value missing in Month). Therefore, they will not affect our analysis, as well.

Overall in the three years period, California has the most number of deaths with about 900,000 deaths reported, followed by Texas’s about 700,000 deaths and Florida’s about 500,000 deaths. Other parts that stands out are the northeastern states, some southeastern states and Arizona. Other states each has an average of 100,000 deaths reported. In 2021 and 2022, the states have the similar death distribution as the total deaths in the 3 years period. In 2020, Texas stands out together with California in the number of deaths reported in state. The total deaths reported in United States in 2020 is relatively the lowest comparing to the other years, and the total deaths reported in United States in 2021 is relatively the largest comparing to other years observing from the graph. Besides, from 2020 to 2022, the number of deaths in the Eastern US increases compared with other places since there is a increasing number of states in the eastern US jump out of the lowest bar. 4.2 Graph 2 4.2.1 2020-2022 4.2.2 2020 4.2.3 2021 4.2.4 2022 In 2020-2022, from the deaths reported, people in United States with COVID-19 only, respiratory diseases, and circulatory diseases take a large proportion. The group with all other conditions and causes(residual) take up a noticeable proportion as well in the population. Other conditions like intentional and unintentional injury, vascular and unspecified dementia, and obesity take a very small proportion of deaths. To conclude the findings by analyzing the conditional groups, we can say that we need to pay more attention to people with circulatory and respiratory diseases because they are more likely to die due to COVID-19 virus. 4.3 Graph 3 4.3.1 2020-2022 4.3.2 2020 4.3.3 2021 4.3.4 2022 From analyzing the age groups and conditions of the deaths in United States from 2020-2022, for those deaths reported with underlying diseases, people with ages 45+ take up about more than 90%. In the condition of Alzheimer disease and vascular and unspecified dementia, people with ages 85+ take up more than 50% of the deaths in these condition groups. The next dangerous age group is ages 75-84, also takes about 25% of the proportion deaths. For the other conditions except obesity, age groups of 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, and 85+ each take up about 20% in each of those conditions. In the obesity group, age groups of 25-34, 45-44, 45-54 have noticeable increases in the proportion deaths comparing to other condition groups, and people with ages 85+ this time takes up only about less than 5% of the proportion deaths. To conclude, people that are older than 55 with some underlying diseases are easier to experience severe symptoms and easier to die from COVID-19. 4.4 Graph 4 4.4.1 2020-2022 4.4.2 2020 4.4.3 2021 4.4.4 2022 The graphs of condition groups by COVID-19 deaths in 2020-2022 also clearly support our previous conclusion that people with respiratory diseases, circulatory diseases and COVID-19 only takes up a large proportion of COVID-19 deaths in United States in that period, and the older the age, the higher chance of you dying from COVID-19 deaths. We can observe that the blue and dark green points are far from the others representing high number of deaths, and the distribution for COVID-19, respiratory diseases and circulatory diseases are far more spread out than other conditions with the older age groups each having more than 200,000 deaths comparing with other conditions with points more concentrated below 100,000 deaths. Besides, we can see that in the year of 2021, the proportion of deaths among elderly people (older than 65) with COVID-19 and circulatory diseases decreases a lot compared with other time periods. 4.5 Graph 5 In graph 5 we further explores the two condition groups - respiratory diseases and circulatory diseases by their sub-conditions respectively through mosaic plots. The two mosaic plots gives the proportion of COVID-19 deaths that each sub-condition accounts for from 2020 to 2022. For respiratory diseases, the distribution of sub-conditions doesn’t vary much over time, and the proportion taken by each condition remains relatively steady. Influenza and adult respiratory distress syndromes are the two major conditions that lead to the most of COVID-19 deaths caused by respiratory diseases. On the other hand, the proportion distribution of sub-conditions for circulatory diseases is more even. Hypertensive diseases account for the largest fraction but it is not significantly greater than other conditions. Similarly, the distribution remains relatively steady over time. 4.6 Graph 6 4.7 Graph 7 Graph 6 &amp; 7 are here to illustrate the mosaic plots in graph 5 more quantatitively. During the severe COVID-19 period 2020-2022, the highest proportion deaths of United States’ citizen is conditioned by respiratory diseases of close to 500,000 deaths. In the respiratory disease group category, 200,000 deaths are people with also Influenza and pneumonia, and 170,000 are people with respiratory failures. 4.8 Graph 8 Graph 8 aims to explore the number of deaths in different age groups from 2020 to 2022. The sequential color depth encoding in a heatmap is very intuitive for visualizing this difference. In terms of age groups, it is very obvious that elder age groups are more vulnerable to COVID-19 in terms of the number of fatal cases, and the difference can be huge. For example, the number of fatal case for the age group 65-74 is more than hundred times the fatal cases of age group 0-24 in all times. This result indicates that age is a very important factor in determining the fatality of COVID-19, and more medical resources should be focused on the elder age groups. In terms of time period, the situation in 2021 was worse than 2020, and then got better in 2022. This could be the result of implementing effective prevention methods like vaccines and virus mutations. 4.9 Graph 9 Graph 9 is a time series plot of COVID-19 deaths. It demonstrates the pandemic’s progression from 2020 to 2022. The first peak came in 2020-05, which was only two months after start of the pandemic, indicating that COVID-19 is highly infectious and capable of exponential growth. The second peak occured on 2021-02, which was nearly twice as much as the first peak. but soon start to decrease sharply. In 2022-02, there was a third and last peak, which might indicate the occurrance of a variation of the virus. 4.10 Graph 10 Graph 10 explores the relationship between the number of COVID-19 deaths and locations. The time series plots of COVID-19 fatal cases for each U.S. state is plotted on their respective location on the U.S. map, giving an intuitive demonstration of how the progression of COVID-19 differs between different states. California, Texas and Florida are the states with the most COVID-19 death cases. Those three states have a large population base, so people live more closely to each other and thus make the implementation of social distancing and other effective prevention methods harder. On the other hand, most states have a similar trend of COVID-19 death cases over time, which also corresponds to the trend we discovered from the previous national-wide time series plot. Besides, states that went through a peak in the early stage of COVID-19 burst (around March 2020) are mainly in the east coast. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component 5.1 README 5.2 Graph", " Chapter 5 Interactive component 5.1 README This interactive plot includes death-date curve for each state. By clicking on the target state on the map, its death-date curve will show below. Besides, you can see the state name and its total number of deaths by putting the mouse on the target state for about 1.5s. The darker the color on the map, the higher the number of deaths is. By interaction, we can integrate specific data values into each plot since the plotting space increased. Therefore, more accurate information can be acquired through the graph. 5.2 Graph When we build book locally, the graph can be successfully shown but somehow when we access the book by url, it disappears. Therefore, we upload files of interactive part in this link https://github.com/KenSu223/5702_d3. Please follow the README procedure to view the graph. US Map "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion 6.1 Main takeways of our exploration 6.2 Limitations 6.3 Future directions 6.4 Lessons learned", " Chapter 6 Conclusion 6.1 Main takeways of our exploration By chloropleth maps, we discovered that the states with most number of deaths in the US are California (with about 900,000 deaths reported), Texas (with about 700,000 deaths reported) and Florida (with about 500,000 deaths reported). For the year of 2021 and 2022, states have the similar death distribution as the total deaths in the 3 years period. In 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2020-2022, the death distribution in each state by condition groups remained basically consistent. Among various condition groups, people with COVID-19 only, respiratory diseases and circulatory diseases suffered the most. This reminds us putting more emphasize on people with these three condition groups. Except obesity, people with ages 45+ take up about more than 90% in those deaths reported. Among them, for people with alzheimer disease and vascular and unspecified dementia, more than half of the death cases are in age group of 85+. For other conditions, 4 age groups between 55 and 85+ each take up about 20%. For people with obesity, only about less than 5% of the death patients are 85+. In conclusion, people older than 55 are more likely to experience severe symptoms, thus dying from COVID-19. Respiratory diseases and circulatory diseases are two major condition groups in death cases. From 2020 to 2022, the distribution of sub-conditions under them remains nearly the same. In respiratory diseases, influenza and adult respiratory distress syndromes are major conditions. In circulatory diseases, the distribution of sub-conditions is much more even and hypertensive diseases is the major condition. In the past three years, approximately 500,000 COVID-19 deaths were among people with respiratory diseases. Among them, 200,000 deaths cases were conditioned by influenza and pneumonia, and 170,000 death cases were conditioned by respiratory failures. The number of fatal cases for elder age groups can be more than hundred times the one for younger age groups, showing that elder groups are more vulnerable to COVID-19. Besides, from 2020 to 2022, the situation first got worse in 2021 and then got better in 2022. The reason behind could be effective prevention methods and virus mutations. In the past 3 years, there were 4 peaks for the entire United States. They came in 2020-05, 2021-02, 2021-10 and 2022-02 respectively. Most states have a similar trend of COVID-19 death cases as the one for the entire United States. States that went through a peak in the early stage of COVID-19 burst (around March 2020) are mainly in the east coast. 6.2 Limitations Due to the large size of the data, memory of our computers is not enough for us to some graphs which may provide us with more insight. For instance, we are unable to plot heatmap during the missing value analysis. In some charts, since there are too many elements and the value of each element differs greatly, it is hard for readers to obtain complete information on stationary plots. 6.3 Future directions To help readers grasp information in those graphs more accurately and conveniently, we would like to integrate those graphs into a huge interactive one. Readers can get access to different charts of each state and the whole country by merely click on the mouse. Besides, for easier comparison, readers are allowed to select multiple states at the same time so that they can see their disparities more directly. 6.4 Lessons learned Through the project, we have truly experienced the whole process of EDAV from proposal, to data collection, to data cleaning/transformation, to missing value analysis and to data analysis. During data analysis, we have learned to choose the best visualization plots for our analysis purpose. In this case, we have utilized chloropleth maps, horizontal stacked bar charts, scatter plots, mosaic plots, heat maps and geo-facets. The interactive design part offers us with an opportunity to explore the importance of d3 interaction. In this case, we utilize d3 to make our last graph interactive, which is a geo-facet plot regarding the death-date curve of each state. The interaction design enabled us to integrate specific data values into each plot since the plotting space increased. Therefore, more accurate information can be acquired through the graph.

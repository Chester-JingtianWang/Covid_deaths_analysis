# Project Description
Through this project, we aim to provide a comprehensive and thorough analysis of the data on COVID-19 deaths in the United States. We will classify death cases by people's ages, states, condition groups, and conditions, and use bar charts, line graphs, and other visualizations to uncover insights and highlight the most important findings.
